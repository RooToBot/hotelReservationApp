Program is a simulation for hotel reservation. Calculates the total fee, gives discount if number of nights to stay is more than 9 days.

## Getting Started

Press 1 + Enter
  Then input your date information, in 6 steps.
  
Press 2 + Enter
  Section:2 Will print available rooms in your case.

Press 3 + Enter
  Section:2 Will calculate total cost for your plan, nightly fee is 20$ for less than 10 day plans normally it's 16$.
  

Last thing to do is pressing enter to go on or 'q' to Exit() in every section.



### cons:
  Reservation date per room in .txt file is just for one date.
  Whatever you want to do, You must go step by step. Such as 1.. 2.. 3.. Can't cross section:2
